      On the "Build a query" tab, a user can click the "Add term" button to create a second search term. For the first
      term, he or she might, e.g., select "BGC type" as category and enter "nrps" as the search string. For the second term,
      he or she could, e.g., select "monomer" as category and enter "dhpg" as search string, and hit "search".

      On the "Build a query" tab, a user could click the "Add term" button twice to create a second and third search term.
      For the first term, he or she could select "genus" as category and enter "Streptomyces" as the search string. For the second
      term, "BGC type" would be "ripp". The operation should be switched from "AND" to "EXCEPT". For the third
      term, "BGC type" could be selected as category and "lantipeptide" entered as search string.

      <hr /> This query currently yields 265 clusters. To save the results for further analysis, the result table can be downloaded
      as CSV file that can then be opened in a spreadsheet application.

      On the "Build a query" tab, a user can click "NRPS/PKS Domain" on the "Search" setting, and "FASTA" on
      "Return data in format".
      Afterwards he or she could click the "Add term" button once to create a second search term.
      For the first term, he or she could select "NRPS/PKS domain" as category and enter "ACP" as the search string.
      For the second term, "NRPS/PKS domain" would be the category again, and "PKS_KS" the search string. The operation would be
      changed to "OR".
